        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Habib!</h2>
        <p>
          <h8>I wrote this blog to create awareness of cyber security because cyber-criminals always think that the end user is the weakest of any system.</h8>
            <br><br>
            I worked with the UN on several international projects and attended many IT training workshops and seminars. My primary goal is to provide essential awareness of how data follow between two devices and what protocol is used to carry data.

                <h3>Layer Four of OSI Model</h3>
                <p>
TCP/IP was not designed with any absolute security in mind. Oh sure, you can put a username and password on FTP, Telnet, and other TCP/IP applications, but everything else is wide open.
Every device with a public IP address on the internet is constantly bombarded with malicious packets and attackers trying to get access to precious data.
In the early days, data moving between sender and receivers was quickly intercepted and read because there was no security on TCP/IP protocols.
Bad actors make millions by stealing data in hundreds of thousands of different ways, and TCP/IP in its original form is all but powerless to stop them.

                <h3>Making TCP/IP Secure</h3>
                <p>
With the following method, we can secure a TCP/IP protocol.
Encryption means scrambling, mixing up, or changing data in such a way that bad guys can’t read it. Of course, this scrambled-up data must also be easily descrambled by the person on receiving end.
Integrity is the process that guarantees that the data received is the same as originally sent. Integrity covers situations where someone intercepts your data during the transaction or stationary and makes changes.
Non-repudiation means that a person cannot deny taking a specific action.Bob sends a message; that message can be traced back specifically to Bob.
